"""
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Strategy:
Generate the largest palindromes possible.
Check for each palinderome if it has two 3 digit factors.
